In vscode there are a lot of shortcuts and easy ways to go about doing things. One of the main ones that are used commonly is the boilerplate shortcut. Here is a short example on how to use the shortcut.

# 1. Basic Shortcut
On the first line of code within **HTML** use **!** and press **Tab**
which would look like this
``` html
!
```
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
